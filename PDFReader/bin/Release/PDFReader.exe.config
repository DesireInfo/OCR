If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source.For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive of the code.There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.

You should also get your employer(if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
